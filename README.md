# Xbee3-Arduino
a basic API that simplifies sending Zigbee commands from an Arduino serially connected to Xbee3 device.

currently only UART serial is supported with pins 0 and 1 on Arduino.

if the reciever is connected to an Arduino make sure to handle the packets in that Arduino however you see fit.
